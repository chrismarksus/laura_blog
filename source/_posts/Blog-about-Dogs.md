Hi, it's Laura. Dogs are not toys. This can help you know what to get when you get your dog.

## The Basics
* **Bowls** - For water & food.
* **Food** - You should know what your dogs age is so you know how much food to give your dog.
* **Collar** - You have something to attach a leash and tags.
* **Tags** - If your dog gets lost & proof of ownership.
* **Leash** - You can take a walk to get to know each other.
* **Bed** - Then at night it's comfy. You only have to get if it's on the floor.

## Extras
* **Muzzle** - Then if he or she gets feisty it won't bite.
* **Toys** - When your dog gets to your house he or she will be entertain.

Thanks! for reading.
