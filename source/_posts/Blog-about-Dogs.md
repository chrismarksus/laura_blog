Hi, it's Laura. Dogs are not toys. This can help you know what to get when you get your dog.

## The Basics
* **Bowls** - For water & food.
* **Food** - You should now what your dog is so you now how much food to give your dog.
* **Collar** - So if he gets lost right when you get your dog.
* **Leash** - So you can take a walk to get to know each other.
* **Bed** - Then at night it's comfy. You only have to get if it's on the floor.

## Extras
* **Muzzle** - Then if he or she gets feisty it won't bite.
* **Toys** - So when your dog gets to your house he or she will be entertain.

Thanks! for reading.
