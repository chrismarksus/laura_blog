# Sherlock WHY NOW!!!

 There was a black fluffy dog on the screen I stared at the dog wondering if it could be mine while my mom was saying” you now we can visit him tomorrow? If you want”. I immediately said yes.the next day i raised home but dad got off 6:00 so I waited 3 hours to start going it took 2 hours to get there so we got home about 11:09. On the way home we stopped off at mc, donalds and poured water in a bowl but he didn’t drink any cause he was shivering of scaredness he fell asleep so cutely. In the morning the only thing we could feed him was leftover chicken from last night at Mc,donalds.I figured out he's a border collie and a poodle together. He loved Rosie for a few months.(rosie is my Grandmas dog a doxen mix)Later he started barking and biting her…
 2 days later we brang him to the veterinarian office to get his vaccine.3 weeks later we got him neutered and he had a cone on his head.

 For a while the dogs backed away from him and that was very very sad~.~

 That's all I have for now bye now!!
